## [0.7.3] - 2020-07-26

## [0.7.2] - 2020-07-26

- Quadratic growth of threads number has stopped. The problem was
  observer on Python 3.6 and 3.7 and was not on 3.8, because starting
  with 3.8 `ThreadPoolExecutor` does not spawn new thread if there are
  idle threads in the pool already. The issue was in the fact that for
  each of worker thread we run an event loop which default executor is
  the `ThreadPoolExecutor` with default (by Python) number of threads.
  All this eventually ended up in hundreds of thread created for each
  `GraphqlWsConsumer` subclass.

## [0.7.1] - 2020-07-25

  - `datetime.date`
  - `datetime.time`

## [0.6.0] - 2020-07-25

- Allow `msgpack v1.*` in the dependencies requirements.
- Windows support improved: tests fixed, example fixed.
- Development instructions updated in the `README.md`.
- Removed `graphql-core` version lock, it is hold by `graphene` anyway.
- Many CI-related fixes.

## [0.5.0] - 2020-04-05

- Added support for Python 3.6.
- Dependencies updated and relaxed, now Django 3 is allowed.
- Testing framework improved to run on 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 with Tox.
- Client setup documentation (Python, GraphiQL) improved. Thanks to
  Rigel Kent.
- Error logging added to simplify debugging, error messages improved.
- Fixed wrong year in this changelog (facepalm).
- Configuration management made slightly simple.
- Bandit linter removed as useless.
- More instructions for the package developers in the `README.md` added.

## [0.4.2] - 2019-08-23

- Example improved to show how to handle HTTP auth (#23).

## [0.4.1] - 2019-08-20

- Better error message when Channels channel layer is not available.

## [0.4.0] - 2019-08-20

- Context (`info.context` in resolvers) lifetime has changed. It is now
  an object-like wrapper around [Channels
  scope](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/consumers.html#scope)
  typically available as `self.scope` in the Channels consumers. So you
  can access Channels scope as `info.context`. Modifications made in
  `info.context` are stored in the Channels scope, so they are persisted
  as long as WebSocket connection lives. You can work with
  `info.context` both as with `dict` or as with `SimpleNamespace`.

## [0.3.0] - 2019-08-17

- Added support for GraphQL middleware, look at the
  `GraphqlWsConsumer.middleware` setting.
- Example reworked to illustrate how to authenticate clients.
- Channels `scope` is now stored in `info.context.scope` as `dict`.
  (Previously `info.context` was a copy of `scope` wrapped into the
  `types.SimpleNamespace`). The thing is the GraphQL `info.context` and
  Channels `scope` are different things. The `info.context` is a storage
  for a single GraphQL operation, while `scope` is a storage for the
  whole WebSocket connection. For example now use
  `info.context.scope["user"]` to get access to the Django user model.

## [0.2.1] - 2019-08-14

- Changelog eventually added.
- `GraphqlWsClient` transport timeout increased 5->60 seconds.
- Dependency problem fixed, version numbers frozen in `poetry.lock` file
  for non-development dependencies.
- Tests which failed occasionally due to wrong DB misconfiguration.
