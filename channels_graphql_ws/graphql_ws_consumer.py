"""Channels consumer which implements GraphQL WebSocket protocol.

The `GraphqlWsConsumer` is a Channels WebSocket consumer which maintains
WebSocket connection with the client.

Implementation assumes that client uses the protocol implemented by the
library `subscription-transport-ws` (which is used by Apollo).

        This function will add the "extensions.code" field containing an
        exception class name. A frontend may use this value to handle
        errors properly.

        If your backend throws an Exception, then an error will be formatted
        for a client like this:
            {
                "id": "NNN",

                },
                "type": "connection_error"
            }

        NOTE: If you need to add more fields to the error, then override
