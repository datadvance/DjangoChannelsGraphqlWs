class Subscription(graphene.ObjectType):
    """Subscription type definition.

    Subclass this class to define a GraphQL subscription. The class
    works with `GraphqlWsConsumer` which maintains a WebSocket
    connection with the client.

    The subclass specifies the following methods. You can define each of
    them as a `@classmethod`, as a `@staticmethod`, or even as a regular
    method (like Graphene typically does). It shall work fine either
    way. NOTE, if you define the method as a regular method (not a
    classmethod or a staticmethod) you will receive the first argument
    (`payload`/`root`) into the `self` argument.

        [async] publish(payload, info, *args, **kwds):
            This method invoked each time subscription "triggers".
            Raising an exception here will lead to sending the
            notification with the error. To suppress the notification
            return `Subscription.SKIP`.

            Can be implemented both as a synchronous or as a coroutine
            function. In both cases a method runs in a worker thread
            from the GraphQL-processing threadpool.

            Required.

            Args:
                payload: The `payload` from the `broadcast` invocation.
                info: The value of `info.context` is a Channels
                    websocket context with all the connection
                    information.
                args, kwds: Values of the GraphQL subscription inputs.
            Returns:
                The same the any Graphene resolver returns. Returning
                a special object `Subscription.SKIP` indicates that this
                notification shall not be sent to the client at all.

        [async] subscribe(root, info, *args, **kwds):
            Called when client subscribes. Define this to do some extra
            work when client subscribes and to group subscriptions into
            different subscription groups. Method signature is the same
            as in other GraphQL "resolver" methods but it may return
            the subscription groups names to put the subscription into.

            Can be implemented both as a synchronous or as a coroutine
            function. In both cases a method runs in a worker thread
            from the GraphQL-processing threadpool.

            Optional.

            Args:
                root: Root resolver object. Typically `None`.
                info: The value of `info.context` is a Channels
                    websocket context with all the connection
                    information.
                args, kwds: Values of the GraphQL subscription inputs.

            Returns:
                The list or tuple of subscription group names this
                subscription instance belongs to. Later the subscription
                will trigger on publishes to any of that groups. If
                method returns None (default behavior) then the
                subscription is only put to the default group (the one
                which corresponds to the `Subscription` subclass).

        [async] unsubscribed(root, info, *args, **kwds):
            Called when client unsubscribes. Define this to be notified
            when client unsubscribes.

            Can be implemented both as a synchronous or as a coroutine
            function. In both cases a method runs in a worker thread
            from the GraphQL-processing threadpool.

            Args:
                root: Always `None`.
                info: The value of `info.context` is a Channels
                    websocket context with all the connection
                    information.
                args, kwds: Values of the GraphQL subscription inputs.

    The methods enlisted above receives "standard" set of GraphQL
    resolver arguments. The `info` field has `context` which can be used
    to transmit some useful payload between these methods. For example
    if `subscribe` sets `info.context.zen=42` then `publish` will have
    access to this value as `info.context.zen`.

    Static methods of subscription subclass:
        broadcast: Call this method to notify all subscriptions in the
            group.
        unsubscribe: Call this method to stop all subscriptions in the
            group.
    NOTE: If you call any of these methods from the asynchronous context
    then `await` the result of the call.
