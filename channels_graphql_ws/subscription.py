class Subscription(graphene.ObjectType):
    """Subscription type definition.

    Subclass this the Subscription class to define a GraphQL
    subscription. The class works with the `GraphqlWsConsumer` which
    maintains a WebSocket connection with the client.

    The subclass specifies the following methods. You can define each of
    them as a `@classmethod`, as a `@staticmethod`, or even as a regular
    method (like Graphene typically does). It shall work fine either
    way. NOTE, if you define the method as a regular method (not a
    classmethod or a staticmethod) you will receive the first argument
    (`payload`/`root`) into the `self` argument.

        [async] publish(payload, info, *args, **kwds):
            This method invoked each time subscription "triggers".
            Raising an exception here will lead to sending the
            notification with the error. Technically the WebSocket
            message will contain extra field "extensions.code" holding
            the classname of the exception raised. To suppress the
            notification return `None`.

            Can be implemented as both asynchronous (`async def`) or
            synchronous (`def`) function. Asynchronous implementation
            runs blazingly fast in the main event loop of the main
            thread. You must be careful with blocking calls though. You
            can offload blocking operations to a thread in such cases.
            Synchronous implementation always runs in a worker thread
            which comes with a price of extra overhead.

            Required.

            Args:
                payload: The `payload` from the `broadcast` invocation.
                info: The value of `info.context` is a Channels
                    websocket context with all the connection
                    information.
                args, kwds: Values of the GraphQL subscription inputs.
            Returns:
                The same that any Graphene resolver returns.

        [async] subscribe(root, info, *args, **kwds):
            Called when client subscribes. Define this to do some extra
            work when client subscribes and to group subscriptions into
            different subscription groups. Method signature is the same
            as in other GraphQL "resolver" methods but it may return the
            subscription groups names to put the subscription into.

            Can be implemented as both asynchronous (`async def`) or
            synchronous (`def`) function. Asynchronous implementation
            runs blazingly fast in the main event loop of the main
            thread. You must be careful with blocking calls though. You
            can offload blocking operations to a thread in such cases.
            Synchronous implementation always runs in a worker thread
            which comes with a price of extra overhead.

            Optional.

            Args:
                root: Root resolver object. Typically `None`.
                info: The value of `info.context` is a Channels
                    websocket context with all the connection
                    information.
                args, kwds: Values of the GraphQL subscription inputs.

            Returns:
                The list or tuple of subscription group names this
                subscription instance belongs to. Later the subscription
                will trigger on publishes to any of that groups. If
                method returns None (default behavior) then the
                subscription is only put to the default group (the one
                which corresponds to the `Subscription` subclass).

        [async] unsubscribed(root, info, *args, **kwds):
            Called when client unsubscribes. Define this to be notified
            when client unsubscribes.

            Can be implemented as both asynchronous (`async def`) or
            synchronous (`def`) function. Asynchronous implementation
            runs blazingly fast in the main event loop of the main
            thread. You must be careful with blocking calls though. You
            can offload blocking operations to a thread in such cases.
            Synchronous implementation always runs in a worker thread
            which comes with a price of extra overhead.

            Args:
                root: Always `None`.
                info: The value of `info.context` is a Channels
                    websocket context with all the connection
                    information.
                args, kwds: Values of the GraphQL subscription inputs.

    The methods enlisted above receives "standard" set of GraphQL
    resolver arguments. The `info` field has `context` which can be used
    to transmit some useful payload between these methods. For example
    if `subscribe` sets `info.context.zen=42` then `publish` will have
    access to this value as `info.context.zen`.

    Static methods of subscription subclass:
        broadcast(): Call this to notify all subscriptions in the group.
        unsubscribe(): Call this to stop all subscriptions in the group.

    NOTE: If you call any of these methods from the asynchronous context
    then `await` the result of the call.
