    """PyTest fixture for testing GraphQL WebSocket backends.

    The fixture provides a method to setup GraphQL testing backend for
    the given GraphQL schema (query, mutation, and subscription). In
    particular: it sets up an instance of `GraphqlWsConsumer` and an
    instance of `GraphqlWsClient`. The former one is returned
    from the function.

    Syntax:
        gql(
            *,
            query=None,
            mutation=None,
            subscription=None,
            consumer_attrs=None,
            communicator_kwds=None
        ):

    Args:
        query: Root GraphQL query. Optional.
        mutation: Root GraphQL subscription. Optional.
        subscription: Root GraphQL mutation. Optional.
        consumer_attrs: `GraphqlWsConsumer` attributes dict. Optional.
        communicator_kwds: Extra keyword arguments for the Channels
            `channels.testing.WebsocketCommunicator`. Optional.

    Returns:
        An instance of the `GraphqlWsClient` class which has many
        useful GraphQL-related methods, see the `GraphqlWsClient`
        class docstrings for details.

    Use like this:
    ```
    def test_something(gql):
        client = gql(
            # GraphQl schema.
            query=MyQuery,
