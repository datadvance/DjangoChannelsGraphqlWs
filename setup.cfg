# Disable some checks:
# - D202: No blank lines allowed after function docstring. We cannot
#   follow this, cause Black inject blank line before function
#   declaration and if it is a nested function when this violates this
#   rule.
# - D401: First line should be in imperative mood; try rephrasing. Often
#   it is not possible. Especially for callback functions such as "A new
#   message handler."
# - D403: First word of the first line should be properly capitalized.
#   There is nothing bad in using words like "WebSocket" or
#   "MessagePack" even in the beginning of the docstring.
