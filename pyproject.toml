# Isort configuration.
# https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort/wiki/isort-Settings
# NOTE: Isort treats paths relative to the current working directory,
# so if you run it not from the directory `venv` resides it will not be
# able to properly detect thirdparty modules. Here is the bug report:
# https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort/issues/659
# Current workaround is to provide `--virtual-env` from the command
# line.
# Tune Isort to correspond to the Black style guide:
